Welcome to evabot!

## Getting started locally

### OS X/macOS
This is a short guide for getting started on **macOS** (formerly called OSX).

First make sure that you have Virtualbox and Vagrant installed. One way of doing this is by using [**Homebrew**](http://brew.sh/) and running:
```bash
brew cask install virtualbox
```
and then
```bash
brew cask install vagrant
```

Then go into the root of the evabot project and run `vagrant up`. Done! Now go to `localhost:3000` in your favorite browser and you should see the Rails project up and running. Enjoy!
