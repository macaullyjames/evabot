As always, you can ask for help in the #help channel on Slack (the above badge
will take you to a sign-up form if you haven't joined our team already). If
the documentation is incorrect/incomplete and you want to help out then open an
issue in the issue tracker describing the problem. Of course, PRs are welcome
too ❤️
